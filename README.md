## Building Web Applications

### For Context

This week, we will be grouped based on our Pod (POD A and POD B) to complete two different projects. They are:

1. Hotel Management System (HMS) --> (POD A)
2. Digital Health Management System (DHS) --> (POD B)

A project description, features to implement and approach to follow are in `POD_A.md` and `POD_B.md` file respectively at the root of this project.

At this point you are expect to checkout `POD_A.md` or `POD_B.md` file depending on your POD.

Happy Hacking ...
